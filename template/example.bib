	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

abstract="High-level Synthesis or HLS represented an ambitious attempt by the community to provide capabilities for ``algorithms to gates'' for a period of almost three decades. The technical challenge in realizing this goal drew researchers from various areas ranging from parallel programming, digital signal processing, and logic synthesis to expert systems. This article takes a journey through the years of research in this domain with a narrative view of the lessons learnt and their implication for future research. As with any retrospective, it is written from a purely personal perspective of our research efforts in the domain, though we have made a reasonable attempt to document important technical developments in the history of high-level synthesis.",
